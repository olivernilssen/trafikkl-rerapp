## How to read the documentation

The code is written using function based components. In the file structure of the project, the different components is organized after the function they have in the app. The documentation is structured the same way as the projects file structure.

This means that the headings in the sidebar are the name of different folders (in the projects file structure), in other words the main function of these components. The components are listed under their corresponding "folders".
